                    Many major areas of Sturdy have been redesigned with a lighter theme, that highlights the
                    most important areas of Sturdy when you need them. Let's take a look!

                    The workspace now puts the code front and center. Distracting components like the changelog
                    are now gone, and have made space for <em>feedback</em>, and the <em>new activity feed</em>.
                </mj-text>
                <mj-text font-size="14px" color="#555555" font-family="helvetica">
                    Use <strong>feedback</strong> to ask for feedback on your changes from a peer before you
                    change them. Asking for feedback will send a notification to the person that you want to get
                    feedback from, letting them know that you want their help.

                    The home of your codebase has also been redesigned to match, with a lighter theme that's
                    more focused on showing you what you need. The page is now featuring the codebases
                    <code>README.md</code>, and the first-time setup instructions have been greatly improved.

                    The changelog is now much faster, loading new data in just a few milliseconds. The page has
                    also been redesigned to fit with the new colours and layout. From the changelog, you can
                    find the complete history of your project, just like you're used to.

                <mj-text font-size="14px" color="#555555" font-family="helvetica">
                    From the changelog, you can now also <strong>view the entire file</strong> as it currently
                    looks like on trunk.

                    I'm really stoked about how the new sidebar looks and feels. We've been taking inspiration
                    from some of our favourite real-time collaboration tools, and are brining the same
                    experience to coding.

                    The sidebar organizes all of your codebases and workspaces, and makes it easy to get an
                    overview of what's going on. And the sidebar will intelligently inform you where your
                    attention is needed and where there has been new activity.

                    in Sturdy. ACLs in Sturdy are really powerful, and enables you to give fine grained access
                    to codebases, <em>including to files</em>.
                </mj-text>
                <mj-text font-size="14px" color="#555555" font-family="helvetica">
                    The file ACL allows you to control who on your team can see what files. For example if you
                    want to invite consultants to collaborate on only a part of your project. Or if you want to
                    store sensitive files in your project, that only some team members should have access to.

                <mj-text font-size="14px" color="#555555" font-family="helvetica">
                    The permissions for <code>files</code> resources affects both which files that are synced to
                    your workstation, and which files that you can see on the web.

                    Together with Sturdy's integration with GitHub, Sturdy can now also operate as a access
                    control-proxy for your existing projects on git.

                    Notification in Sturdy has received a huge upgrade. Workspaces that need your attention are
                    now <strong>highlighted in the sidebar</strong>, so that you get an easy overview of what
                    has changed since the last time you where online.

                    Sturdy now also supports <strong>browser notifications</strong>, to notify you immediately
                    when something has changed. When you click the bell icon (lower left of the screen) the next
                    time, Sturdy will ask you for your permission to send you notifications.
