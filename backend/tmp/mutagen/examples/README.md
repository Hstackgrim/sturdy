# Examples

This directory contains example projects that use Mutagen's
[orchestration mechanisms](https://mutagen.io/documentation/orchestration) to
automate the process of using synchronization and forwarding with containerized
development environments. There are two types of examples: those using
[Mutagen's Docker Compose integration](https://mutagen.io/documentation/orchestration/compose)
and those using Mutagen's more generic
[project](https://mutagen.io/documentation/orchestration/projects) mechanism.
