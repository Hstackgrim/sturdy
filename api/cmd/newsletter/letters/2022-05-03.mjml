                        Hey ducklings (that's you, all Sturdy fans!) Sturdy <code>v1.8.0</code> is just
                        <em>fresh of the compiler</em>
                        and we'd like to share all of the goodies in this new
                        release.

                    The
                    <a href="https://github.com/sturdy-dev/sturdy/blob/api/v1.8.0/CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG</a>
                    contains a condensed list of everything that's new, but in this post we're digging deeper
                    into all of the new features and improvements.

                <h2>Undo and redo</h2>

                <mj-text font-size="14px" color="#555555" font-family="helvetica">
                    Behind the scenes, Sturdy has been been operating on "snapshots" for a while now. It's
                    what's powering all of our drafts, and for example powers the automatic store and restore of
                    changes when you're jumping between drafts.
                </mj-text>

                <mj-text font-size="14px" color="#555555" font-family="helvetica">
                    Snapshots are a stored in a linked list, where each draft has a "head" snapshot, that in
                    turn can have a "parent" snapshot (this becomes important later).
                </mj-text>

                <mj-text font-size="14px" color="#555555" font-family="helvetica">
                    Sturdy automatically creates snapshots in the background when you're coding (or really, when
                    we detect changes to files on your filesystem), and when you're doing manual actions to a
                    draft through the UI (such as undoing a file).
                </mj-text>

                <mj-text font-size="14px" color="#555555" font-family="helvetica">
                    The new undo/redo functionality operates entirely on the snapshots, and exposes them to the
                    user.
                </mj-text>

                <mj-image src="https://getsturdy.com/assets/undo-redo.db289814.png" alt="Undo and redo on Sturdy"></mj-image>


                <mj-text font-size="14px" color="#555555" font-family="helvetica">
                    Undoing restores the code changes in the draft to the state as it was of a previous snapshot. And
                    takes just a few milliseconds to run. Clicking undo again, will restore you to an even earlier
                    state. Redoing moves you forward to the state that you recently undid from.
                    I guess that's a long way to describe that we've introduced Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y support to Sturdy!

                <mj-text font-size="18px" color="#000" font-family="helvetica">CI/CD on drafts</mj-text>

                <mj-text font-size="14px" color="#555555" font-family="helvetica">
                    <a href="https://getsturdy.com/blog/2022-04-12-this-week-at-sturdy">In v1.7.0</a>
                    we
                    introduced support for running your automated testing via first-party integrations. In
                    <code>v1.8.0</code>
                    we're expanding the support for CI/CD over the "Sturdy for GitHub"
                    bridge and are adding support for all CI/CD providers that integrate with GitHub, including
                    GitHub Actions, CircleCI, and more! This works by pushing a the draft to a branch named
                    <code>sturdy-ci-${NAME}</code>
                    to GitHub, and using the push event as the trigger to run the
                    tests.

                    The <a href="https://getsturdy.com/docs/continuous-integration">CI/CD documentation</a> has
                    been updated and goes further in-depth about how this works.

                        <li>
                            <strong>[Improvement]</strong>
                            Improved caching of codebase contents, making operations
                            like "undo" and "merge" significantly faster
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>[Improvement]</strong>
                            Fixed a data-race where sometimes a change could be
                            imported (from GitHub or other) multiple times (leading to a confusing changelog)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>[Improvement]</strong>
                            Improved reliability when importing extremely large pull
                            requests (+100k lines changed)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>[Improvement]</strong>
                            Better performance when GitHub webhook delivery is slow
                            (added internal handling that does not rely on webhooks)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>[Improvement]</strong>
                            Register the Sturdy app as a handler for the
                            <code>sturdy://</code>
                            protocol scheme on Linux (App Images, deb, and rpm)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>[Fix]</strong>
                            Improved first time boot performance of the server, and fixed a
                            race condition where sometimes the server did not successfully start the first time.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>[Fix]</strong>
                            Fixed a bug where navigation between drafts could take you to the
                            wrong page
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>[Fix]</strong>
                            Fixed a bug where the callback from GitHub after updating
                            permissions for the Sturdy app could take you to an unexpected page
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>[Fix]</strong>
                            Fixed a bug where comments on "live" code could sometimes "jump"
                            around
                        </li>
                    </ul>
