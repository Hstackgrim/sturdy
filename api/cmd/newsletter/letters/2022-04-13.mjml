                        Since

                        versions of Sturdy (v1.5.0, v1.6.0, and v1.7.0).
                        <i>
                            (Minor releases when speaking in Semver, but major when it comes to what they enable, and
                            how proud we are of them!)

                    <p>
                        Sturdy <code>v1.5.0</code> introduced a new workflow in Sturdy, with Sturdy running on top
                        of <strong>any</strong> Git repository and provider. Sturdy can now
                        <router-link :to="{ name: 'docsIntegrationsGit' }">connect natively</router-link>
                        over the git-protocol to any hosting provider, and brings all of the power and ease-of-use
                        of using Sturdy to providers such as GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The same release also added a much-needed improvement to the search in Sturdy, and support
                        for running Sturdy on <code>linux/arm64</code> and automatic TLS support via Let's Encrypt.
                    </p>

                    <p><code>v1.6.0</code> introduced SSH support for the Git integration.</p>

                    <p>
                        <code>v1.7.0</code> added a one-click-ship üö¢ feature to GitHub, where Sturdy can create a
                        PR and merge it for you right away. Shipping your code with Sturdy is now
                        <i>literally</i> 1-click away. We also focused on code-review in v1.7.0, bringing
                        code-review of code written outside of Sturdy to Sturdy. Sturdy now makes all open pull
                        requests to your repository available as <i>draft changes</i> in Sturdy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This release also contained support for triggering and running your CI/CD pipelines based on
                        any draft, at any time. So that you can utilize the powers of your CI runners to run your
                        tests of your non-commited changes, and keeping my computer fans nice and idle. ;-)
