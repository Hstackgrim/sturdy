                    Sturdy has previously been a mixed experience between using Sturdy in the browser, and the
                    Sturdy CLI (to manage the connection to your filesystem). This is finally about to change
                    &mdash; <strong>Sturdy is going native!</strong>
                </mj-text>

                <mj-text font-size="14px" color="#555555" font-family="helvetica">
                    The Sturdy app (for Mac, Linux, and Windows) greatly improves how Sturdy interacts with your
                    system. The app is bundled with everything you need to get started, and thereâ€™s no longer
                    any need to use the cli (in fact, weâ€™re deprecating it).
                </mj-text>

                <mj-text font-size="14px" color="#555555" font-family="helvetica">
                    No additional authentication step is required, all you need to do to get started is to
                    download the app and log in, and youâ€™re ready to code!
                </mj-text>

                <mj-text font-size="14px" color="#555555" font-family="helvetica">
                    The ability to use Sturdy in the browser is not going away, but some actions, like
                    connecting a Sturdy to a directory on your computer, will only be available through the app.
                </mj-text>

                    <strong>Weâ€™re looking for more beta testers</strong> (especially testers on Linux and
                    Windows), if youâ€™re interested, please reply to this email!

                    The home for each codebase in Sturdy has received a facelift! Itâ€™s now highlighting up to 4
                    of the latest changes in the codebase, giving you quick access to all files in the codebase
                    (<i

                <mj-text font-size="14px" color="#555555" font-family="helvetica">
                    When youâ€™re setting up Sturdy from GitHub, any open pull requests that you might have will
                    now be imported as Workspaces in Sturdy. Just like before, any updates that you make to the
                    code in this workspace, will be pushed to your existing PR.
                </mj-text>

                <mj-text font-size="14px" color="#555555" font-family="helvetica">
                    To keep your busy projects from annoying you, you can now
                    <strong>watch your favourite workspaces</strong>, and youâ€™ll only be notified about changes
                    in your watched workspaces.
                </mj-text>

                <mj-text font-size="14px" color="#555555" font-family="helvetica">
                    Interacting with a workspace, such as when giving some feedback on it, will cause you to
                    watch it.

                <mj-text font-size="14px" color="#555555" font-family="helvetica">
                    Sturdy now also supports @-mentions in comments, mentioning someone will always notify them,
                    and also highlight the workspace that they were mentioned in with a badge in the sidebar.

                <mj-text font-size="14px" color="#555555" font-family="helvetica">

                <mj-text font-size="14px" color="#555555" font-family="helvetica">
                    This is a completely Sturdy-native experience, and does not rely on git. The native CI/CD
                    integration supports large files, file level permissions, and more. Oh, and itâ€™s very fast!
                </mj-text>

                <mj-text font-size="14px" color="#555555" font-family="helvetica">
                    Reach out if youâ€™re interested in getting access to the beta, and let us know which CI/CD
                    provider that we should integrate with next!
