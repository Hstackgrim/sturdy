    <template #introduction>
      Hey everyone! This week we‚Äôve been focusing on how Sturdy can help you if you make a mistake,
      or change your mind about what you‚Äôre building.
    </template>
    <template #default>
      <p>
        <strong>We‚Äôre introducing Snapshots</strong>, which allows you to time-travel to any
        previous point in history, similar to the history of a Google Docs document, or Apple‚Äôs Time
        Machine!
      </p>

      <p>
        With Sturdy it‚Äôs now safer than ever to do experiments or crazy refactoring, without having
        to worry about how to get back to a working state if your experiment doesn‚Äôt go according to
        plan ‚Äî and according to me, this is the coolest feature of Sturdy so far!
      </p>

      <h2>Snapshots</h2>
      <p>
        It‚Äôs OK to make mistakes, for me it‚Äôs a core part of the development process. I write some
        code to experiment with a library, or an idea. The first attempt might not work out, so I
        back out, remove some of my code and try again! This is what the development process looks
        like for me many-many times per day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sturdy now fully embraces this workflow, and allows you to switch back and forth between
        stages of your code, with what we‚Äôre calling <strong>Snapshots</strong>. Snapshots are fully
        automatic, and allows you to
        <strong>restore the workspace to what it looked like at any point in the past</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>I was previously hinting this on Twitter, and it‚Äôs now available for everyone!</p>

      <p>This is what it looks like (real screenshot, of me building the feature itself)!</p>

      <p>I‚Äôm excited to see how Snapshots will improve everyones workflows!</p>

      <h2>Undo</h2>

      <h2>Sharing a change with the team</h2>
      <p>
        On the topic of making mistakes, after you‚Äôve created a change (the equivalent of a
        ‚Äúcommit‚Äù), you can now easily undo it, if you for example change your mind or if you added
        to many or too few changes to it. Easy! Undoing takes you back to exactly where you where
        before the change was made.
      </p>

        <img
          class="w-max-[100%] rounded-lg block m-auto"

          width="978"
          height="213"
        />
      </figure>

      <h2>Smaller news</h2>
      <p>Codebases can now be archived!</p>

      <figure class="text-center">
        <img
          class="w-max-[100%] rounded-lg block m-auto"
          src="./003.png"
          alt=""
          width="978"
          height="254"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        Changes that where introduced by reverting an earlier change, now have a link to the change
        that they are reverting.
      </p>
