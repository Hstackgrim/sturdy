      <h3>Physical Access</h3>
      <p>Sturdy does not have any physical servers. All of our services run in the cloud.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>Files on your computer</h3>
          <p>
            Sturdy stores metadata in the users home directory in the following directories and
            files
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>~/.sturdy-agent</code></li>
            <li><code>~/.sturdy-sync</code></li>
            <li><code>~/.sturdy</code></li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Sturdy also needs read/write access to the user-provided directories that Sturdy should
            monitor for code changes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sturdy will also automatically access the <code>~/.ssh/known_hosts</code> file to
            configure SSH trust to Sturdy's servers.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h3>Testing and review</h3>
          <p>
            Sturdy applies code review and automated and manual testing of all changes to the Sturdy
            software.
          </p>

          <h3>File communication to Sturdy</h3>
          <p>
            The local application communicates with the Sturdy API over HTTP with TLS, using a
            temporary (30 day) JWT (JSON Web Token). This token is rotated by the client in the
            background.
          </p>

          <p>
            File transfers between a client and Sturdy are made over SSH, and are authenticated with
            4096-bit RSA keys. The private key(s) are generated on the client, and will never leave
            the client computer.
          </p>

          <h3>User logins</h3>
          <p>
            User passwords are cryptographically hashed and salted before being stored in our
            database.
          </p>

          <h3>Employee access to data</h3>
          <p>
            Sturdy employees will only ever access customer data when itâ€™s required for support
            related duties. When this happens, staff will do their best to respect customer privacy,
            and only access the code and settings required to debug the issue at hand.
          </p>
          <p>All sessions and actions are logged, and regularly reviewed.</p>
